Simple space-themed landing page.
Project based on the odinproject curriculum.

## Log of Learning

1. First I set up the outline. 
I used divs at first, but now understanding there are tags that can be used besides div and a class name.
Going to make use of nav header footer main and so on.

2. I have prepped my stylesheet using a style reset template.
I made a few changes here for best practice, and have read and
watched some supplementary material to help me understand more about document setup.

3. Installed color-picker on machine to look for color codes. I want to create a theme for the site that is not the default in the lesson

4. I picked a theme and also learned how to make these markdown files look a little better. Added [Style-Guide.md](./style-guide.md) to keep track of overall theme of the website.
