Simple space-themed landing page.
Project based on the odinproject curriculum.

## Log of Learning

1. First I set up the outline. 
I used divs at first, but now understanding there are tags that can be used besides div and a class name.
Going to make use of nav header footer main and so on.

2. I have prepped my stylesheet using a style reset template.
I made a few changes here for best practice, and have read and
watched some supplementary material to help me understand more about document setup.

3. Installed color-picker on machine to look for color codes. I want to create a theme for the site that is not the default in the lesson.

4. Picked theme colors and also learned how to make these markdown files look a little better. Added [Style-Guide.md](./style-guide.md) to keep track of overall theme of the website.

5. Added a ton of :root variables for my CSS. (can't wait to learn SaSS!) Learned about the 62.5% font sizing rule, as well as rem

6. Fixed the structure of the html for the header and the title card
Also added utility classes so any section can have them and add specific styling I want. Specific ones have specific classes, as per usual. Cuts down on making a million classes with specificity.

7. Did not overuse flex for my right and left title cards. Struggled adding spacing to my left and right title cards, may look to using alternate solutions. For now, added some margins and padding.

8. Fixed some spacing with the footer and added a background color to the body to make things less awkward.

9. Future improvements would be to figure out how to make things stack correctly, keep the images from shrinking with resizing. Learned quite a bit about structure. I will hopefully learn how to use grid, as flexbox can be a bit finicky with my methods applied.
